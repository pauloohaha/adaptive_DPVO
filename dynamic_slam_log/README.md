# Adaptive DPVO benchmark

This folder contains the tool scripts to process the data recorded for the adaptive DPVO devlopment.

# Usage

## 1. Use modified dpvo and evaluate script to log data

Use **evaluate_euroc.py** to run the DPVO, it can loop through the datasets and different configurations.

In the **dpvo/dpvo.py**, some lists such as **dynamic_debug_confidence_average_log** are added to log the confidence value during the test run. These logged value are passed to **evaluate_euroc.py** script to dump in to a pickle file.

## 2. Phrase the recorded data

The **dynamic_slam_log/dynamic_slam_log_praser.py** can read the pickle file created by the evaluation script. It then aglin the data using the time step to eliminate the empty data created during the initialization and some trailing empty slots. It then plots the data with respect to time step. It is capable to plot the data until each time step and show the original dataset image for creating a video.

The **dynamic_slam_log/dynamic_slam_log_config_comp.py** script is used for comparing the results from different test runs.

## 3. Generate video to visualize the change of the logged data during test runs

The **dynamic_slam_log/plot_viewer.py** can take the image streams generated by the **dynamic_slam_log/dynamic_slam_log_praser.py** and show it in video format. Remember to use X-forwarding supported terminal and add **-x** when connecting to the server.
